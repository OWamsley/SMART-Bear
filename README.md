### Pushing to the Repo
Due to merge conflicts we will have a seperate branch for each team of developers or task. We can then use these branches to push code without causing merge conflicts between the teams/tasks. Below are the instructions to change branches.

Make Sure to Checkout Jacob's Tutorial. It is amazing [Video Link](https://youtu.be/0urqEJmf73s)

To create a branch you can either follow the steps below or ask me (John Minney) and I can get it set up for you.
> * While looking at the Github page for the project look for a dropdown menu that will most likely say "main"
> * Click on this dropdown and make sure you are on the main branch
> * Enter the name of your new branch in the text box
> * Once you enter the name there will be a section that says "Create branch: branch_name from 'main'
> * Click that and it will create the new branch
> * Once you have created the new branch pull on your local machine and you will be able to checkout the new branch

For the following steps replace *branch_name* with your teams working branch.
If you are using git bash (command line) follow these steps to switch branches.
> If you are using a UI follow their documentation or tutorial videos to switch branches
* Find your way to the local version of the project
* Type the command `git branch -a`
* If you don't see your branch listed run `git pull`
* If you can locate your branch use the command `git checkout branch_name`
* You are now working on your team's branch. Push code like you would normally

**Important!!**
The first time you push to the branch use the command `git push -u origin branch_name`

When you are done working on your branch create a Pull Request for the code to be reviewed. This will allow me to ensure that any new code won't cause a merge conflict on the production version.
